# handy-dandy-scripts

A collection of scripts that are simple and handy dandy AF.

The contents of this repo are a mix of self-coded scripts and things I have find while surfing the fringes of the world wide wide. 

As of 2020-09-25 scripts are organized into folders by language, e.g. python, bash, node(javascript) with each script as a standalone file with a name descriping what it does, e.g. bashj/bulk_whois_domain_lookup.sh

Comments are optional, and will generally only be included if I feel the need to notate something for future use.
